# PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Rainfall has been a major concern these days. Weather conditions have been changing for time being. Rainfall forecasting is important otherwise, it may lead to many disasters. Irregular heavy rainfall may lead to the destruction of crops, heavy floods that can cause harm to human life. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity, and pre-planning of water structures. Thus, our problem is to analyse the rainfall data in India in order to help the growth of agriculture by predicting the occurrence of heavy rainfall to prevent flooding and damage in crops.

# NOVELTY :
Rainfall prediction is important as heavy rainfall can lead to many disasters. The prediction helps people to take preventive measures and moreover the prediction should be accurate. So, it is important to analyse rainfall in order to prevent damage in crops.
